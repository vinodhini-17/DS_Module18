# Ex29 Travelling Salesman Problem
## DATE:26/4/2025
## AIM:
To write a C Program to implement Travelling Salesman Problem for finding shortest path.
## Algorithm

1. Initialize Global Variables  
   - `a[10][10]`: Cost matrix (travel cost between cities).  
   - `visited[10]`: Flags for visited cities (all initially 0).  
   - `n`: Number of cities, and `cost = 0`: Total minimum cost.

2. Input Data – `get()` Function  
   - Reads number of cities `n` and fills the `a[i][j]` cost matrix.  
   - Initializes all cities as **not visited**.

3. Find Minimum Cost Path – `mincost(city)`  
   - Marks the current city as visited and prints it.  
   - Finds the next city with the **least cost** using `least(city)`.  
   - If all cities are visited, returns to the starting city.  
   - Updates total `cost` and **recursively continues** from the next city.

4. Select Least Cost City – `least(city)`  
   - Checks all unvisited neighbors of the current city.  
   - Picks the city with the **minimum travel cost** and returns it.  
   - Adds the intermediate cost for each decision.

5. Display Result – `put()`  
   - Prints the **total minimum cost** after all cities are visited and returned.

6. Main Function Execution  
   - Calls `get()` → `mincost(0)` → `put()` in sequence.  
   - Begins from city `0` and completes the tour.

	{
			for( j=0;j < n;j++)

	}
	}

void mincost(int city)
{
	int ncity;
	int least(int);
	visited[city]=1;	
	printf("%d -->",city+1);
	ncity=least(city);
	if(ncity==999)
	{
		ncity=0;
		printf("%d",ncity+1);
		cost+=a[city][ncity];
		return;
	}
	mincost(ncity);
}

int least(int c)
{
	int i,nc=999;
	int min=999,kmin;
	for(i=0;i < n;i++)
	{
		if((a[c][i]!=0)&&(visited[i]==0))
			if(a[c][i] < min)
			{
				min=a[i][0]+a[c][i];
				kmin=a[c][i];
				nc=i;
			}
	}
	if(min!=999)
		cost+=kmin;
	return nc;
}

void put()
{
	printf("\n\nMinimum cost:%d",cost);
	}

int main()
{
	get();
	mincost(0);
	put();
	return 0;
	}

```
